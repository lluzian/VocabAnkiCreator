### **Problem:**

Every day, I encounter new English words and phrases that I’m not familiar with. Memorizing them can be challenging, and manually creating Anki flashcards for each word is time-consuming.

### **Solution:**

A tool that effortlessly collects the new words you encounter throughout the week, uses AI to automatically generate comprehensive flashcards, and delivers a complete deck ready for import into Anki. For an even smoother workflow, the tool could later integrate directly with Anki for seamless learning.

### **Core Features**

1. **Capture New Words Quickly**
    - **User Interface:**
    A minimalistic web page with a simple input field for the word or phrase and an optional comment field for additional context.
    - **Data Storage:**
    The captured words are temporarily stored using localStorage for quick and hassle-free data capture.
2. **Generate and Manage AI-Enhanced Flashcards**
    - **Initiate Flashcard Creation:**
    A “Create Anki” feature that triggers the flashcard creation process using the saved words.
    - **AI-Driven Enhancement:**
    For each saved word, the tool creates a tailored prompt (incorporating any provided context) and sends it to an AI API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) to generate a comprehensive flashcard. The resulting flashcard may include:
        - A clear definition
        - An example sentence
        - Synonyms and mnemonic tips
    - **Temporary Storage of Enhanced Flashcards:**
    The AI-enhanced flashcards are stored locally (or in another temporary store) to allow for review and editing.
    - **Export as a Ready-to-Use Deck:**
    The tool converts the enhanced flashcards into a CSV file—a format that Anki readily accepts.
    - **User Actions for Deck Management:**
        - **Download Deck:** A “Download Deck” feature lets users quickly export the CSV file.
        - **Data Cleanup:** A “Clear Data” or “Delete Flashcards” feature allows users to remove the stored flashcards once the export is successful.
